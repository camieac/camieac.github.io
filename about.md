I started at Exterity as an intern in my 3rd year at university, and have kept up appearances ever since.

I was awarded the IET Prize for outstanding acheivement.

# Sports

I swam competitively from around 2012 up until March 2013, competing and training with East Lothian Swim Team.
I'm more of a recreationalist nowadays; enjoying running, rock climbing, hill walking, badminton and whatever else.
